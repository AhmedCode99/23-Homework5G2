# CO2 Concentration Data Analysis

## Overview
This document outlines the analysis of monthly average CO2 concentration data using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to identify and remove high-frequency components. The processed data is then visualized to show the original and cleaned CO2 concentration trends.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## Usage
1. **Clone or Download:** Obtain the script from the repository or download it.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure the required libraries are installed by running `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib`.
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the script.

## Functionality

### Data Loading
The script begins by loading CO2 concentration data from a specified URL using the `load_data` function.

### Raw Data Plotting
The raw CO2 concentration data is plotted to visualize the original trends over time.

### FFT and Frequency Analysis
The script applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to the raw data to obtain frequency domain information. This is visualized through a frequency spectrum plot.

### High-Frequency Component Removal
High-frequency components are identified based on a specified threshold and zeroed out in the frequency domain. The modified frequency spectrum is then visualized.

### Inverse FFT and Cleaned Data Plotting
The inverse FFT is applied to the modified frequency data to obtain cleaned CO2 concentration data. The cleaned data is plotted along with explicit time values on the x-axis.

### Display Plots
All plots, including the raw data, frequency spectrum, modified frequency spectrum, and cleaned data, are displayed for visual inspection.

## Conclusion
This script facilitates a thorough analysis of monthly average CO2 concentration data, encompassing data loading, visualization, frequency analysis, and cleaning of high-frequency components. The resulting visualizations aid in understanding the impact of high-frequency noise on the CO2 concentration trends.
